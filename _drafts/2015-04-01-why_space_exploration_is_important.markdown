#Why space exploration is important
##We have to become a multi-planet species

##It's really complicated and requires a lot of resources

##Resources are on asteroÃ¯ds

##It's going to be complicated but do-able (think going to the moon in '60)
>We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard
>
JFK - Rice

##Great rewards and the ability to pursue our lifestyle
